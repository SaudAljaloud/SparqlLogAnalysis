**Regular Expressions in SPARQL Queries**
-------------------

This is a tool which has been a part of the analysis of regex patterns within SPARQL queries.

Parsing SPARQL queries is done by the Jena arq (Apache License, Version 2.0).

**To compile the code:**

> mvn clean install  
> mvn dependency:copy-dependencies


**How to use:**  
There are different tasks that can be done the logs (you may want to have a look into the paper, see below).  
I've tried to tide up the code into a generic interface.  

run and follow the help within the command.
